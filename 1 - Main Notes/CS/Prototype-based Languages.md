***Prototype-based languages*** are similar to the classical object-orientated way of having a "class" or template to "instantiate" or create new objects in code, referring to **classical inheritance**. However, prototype-based languages use ***prototypal inheritance***, which means that objects are created from another object, not instantiated from a ***class***.
