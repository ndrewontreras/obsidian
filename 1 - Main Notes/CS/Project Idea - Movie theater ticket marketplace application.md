a movie theater app that sells online tickets, make it have multiple retail locations, where you can pick a movie and you can pick your seat, and integrate with a payment system like PayPal or stripe then finally have a notification service that sends an email with confirmation.

If you end up doing crud, I would suggest to invest time and secure it. Create roles, admin, users, whatever and add key token authorisation password,username authentication etc, ideally authenticate with oauth2 and some server eg keycloak. That is senior stuff material. A basic implementation might make your resume stand out, good luck, have fun.
