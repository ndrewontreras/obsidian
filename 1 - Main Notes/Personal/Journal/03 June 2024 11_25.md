Little Luka has yet to gain the courage to leave his warm, cozy home. I've been trying to cut back on smoking but I've been unsuccessful. Time to try something else to cut back. I want to limit to only 3 nightly usages per week. Stacey and I want to start incorporating a routine to help the baby and us be more efficient with our time. My Nina is still her and causing some trouble, but Stacey and I are learning to not let it affect us. I want to return to the gym but need to start sleeping early and waking up early to workout in the morning before the day starts. I can do this, think of it as a training period for my character and body. We all have to go through periods of certain "suffering" to gain new insight and perspective on your situation. You got this Andrew, you have more to lose if you choose otherwise, remember that. Remember death.
