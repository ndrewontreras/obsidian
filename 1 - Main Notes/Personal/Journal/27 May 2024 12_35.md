Today is a Monday, a couple days out of reaching the middle of this year. Our little Luka should be meeting us anytime now. To be honest, I'm surprised he hasn't popped out yet. My mother-in-law flew in a couple of days ago. She is kind of making the current situation a lot more difficult than it should be. It is bothering me because in a way I am taking it personal and letting it affect my emotions. I have to learn to understand that I can't understand everyone. I have to understand that her actions are a product of my actions. But what she chooses to act on is upon her. You shouldn't feel a certain way because she is choosing to act the way she is acting. Remain calm and remember the best thing you can do for yourself, Stacey, Luka, and the rest of the people that you love and love you with lots of support and gratitude, is to put those negative emotions and thoughts aside and learn to love. No one is your enemy Andrew. To be truly strong, is to be kind. Live life like it's your last chance to show and give those around you the love and gratitude that everyone including yourself deserves. Be the example of change and good. I love you Andrew. Quit the smoke, it'll always be there when you come back. Focus on your core attributes, level up your character, live in the moment, be grateful, and when death finally comes, learn to smile back at it. You're strong. I know that man is in you somewhere. Find him.
