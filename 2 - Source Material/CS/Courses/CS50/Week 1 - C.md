compiler - prpgram that tr4anslates one language to another language 

$ - conventional way to indicate your prompt in a CLI

printf - print formatted

make *filename w/o extension* - create machine code file from source code file

./*filename of machine code file* - run the machine code file 

In this example, we have to create the *machine* code every time we edit the source code 

`#include <stdio.h>` , also known as a header, refers to adding the standard IO library (.h file) to the file structure of the program, so the compiler knows what functions like `printf()` are and what their effect is

library - code that was written by someone else, used to implement unique functions to code

on a browser, open manual.cs50.io/#stdio.h, opens an example page of documentation

learning and memorizing libraries is not the objective, but to learn where to find answers when you decide to try something new, i.e. documentation

course uses its own library, cs50.h, to implement simple getter functions for basic data types like get_string() and get_int()

basic program has it's ***arguments***, which get put into a cookie-cutter-like function
