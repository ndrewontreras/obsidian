# What is "business logic"?

"Business logic" refers to the part of an application that encodes the real-world business rules and processes that the application is designed to automate or support. It is the core functionality that governs how data can be created, stored, and changed, and what actions the system can perform based on user interactions or other inputs.

### Key Aspects of Business Logic

1. **Rules and Conditions**:
   - These are the constraints and rules that dictate how data should be processed. For example, in a banking application, a business rule might be that a withdrawal should not exceed the available account balance.

2. **Workflows and Processes**:
   - This includes the sequence of operations or steps that must be performed to complete a business transaction. For instance, an order processing system might involve steps like order validation, payment processing, inventory update, and shipping.

3. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Business logic involves the manipulation of data to perform tasks such as calculations, data transformation, and aggregation. For example, calculating the total price of items in a shopping cart, including taxes and discounts.

4. **Interacting with Other Systems**:
   - Often, business logic includes communication with external systems or services, such as payment gateways, third-party APIs, or internal microservices.

5. **Decision Making**:
   - Business logic often includes making decisions based on inputs and conditions. For example, approving or rejecting a loan application based on the applicant's credit score.

### Where Business Logic Resides in a Spring Boot Application

In a Spring Boot application, business logic typically resides in the service layer. Here’s a breakdown of how it fits into the overall architecture:

1. **Controller Layer**:
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses.
   - Delegates processing to the service layer.
   - Contains minimal logic, primarily for request validation and response formatting.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - Contains the core business logic.
   - Coordinates between the controller and repository layers.
   - Implements business rules, workflows, and data manipulation.

3. **Repository Layer**:
   - Handles data access and persistence.
   - Interacts with the database using Spring Data JPA or other data access technologies.
   - Contains no business logic, only CRUD operations and queries.

### Example of Business Logic in a Service Class

Here’s an example of business logic in a Spring Boot service class for a simple Todo List application:

```java
@Service
public class TaskService {

    @Autowired
    private TaskRepository taskRepository;

    public List<Task> getAllTasks() {
        return taskRepository.findAll();
    }

    public Optional<Task> getTaskById(Long id) {
        return taskRepository.findById(id);
    }

    public Task createTask(Task task) {
        // Business logic: Ensure task title is not empty
        if (task.getTitle() == null || task.getTitle().isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Task title cannot be empty");
        }
        return taskRepository.save(task);
    }

    public Task updateTask(Long id, Task updatedTask) {
        return taskRepository.findById(id)
                .map(existingTask -> {
                    existingTask.setTitle(updatedTask.getTitle());
                    existingTask.setDescription(updatedTask.getDescription());
                    existingTask.setCompleted(updatedTask.isCompleted());
                    return taskRepository.save(existingTask);
                })
                .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Task not found"));
    }

    public void deleteTask(Long id) {
        if (!taskRepository.existsById(id)) {
            throw new ResourceNotFoundException("Task not found");
        }
        taskRepository.deleteById(id);
    }
}
```

### Breaking Down the Business Logic in the Example

1. **Validation**:
   - In `createTask`, there’s a validation to ensure the task title is not empty. This is a business rule.

2. **Exception Handling**:
   - In `updateTask` and `deleteTask`, the code checks if the task exists before attempting to update or delete it. If not, it throws a `ResourceNotFoundException`.

3. **Data Manipulation**:
   - In `updateTask`, the existing task’s properties are updated with the new values from the `updatedTask` object before saving.

### Importance of Business Logic

1. **Ensures Consistency**:
   - Centralizing business logic in the service layer ensures that business rules are consistently applied across the application.

2. **Improves Maintainability**:
   - Keeping business logic separate from other concerns (like data access or presentation) makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Enhances Testability**:
   - With business logic encapsulated in service classes, it’s easier to write unit tests for business rules and workflows without dependencies on web or data layers.

By understanding and effectively implementing business logic in your applications, you ensure that your software not only meets functional requirements but also adheres to the specific rules and processes of the domain it serves.
