### Step 1: Project Planning

#### 1. Define Requirements

1. **Identify Required Information**:
    - **Weather Data**: Determine which weather information you need, such as:
        - Current temperature
        - Humidity levels
        - Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy)
        - Wind speed and direction
        - Atmospheric pressure
        - Sunrise and sunset times
    - **Additional Information**:
        - City name and coordinates
        - Weather forecast (optional: daily, hourly)
2. **Determine Endpoints**:
    - Plan the RESTful endpoints you will provide. For instance:
        - `GET /weather/{city}`: Fetch current weather for a specific city
        - `GET /weather/{city}/forecast`: Fetch weather forecast for a specific city (optional)
    - Consider if you need query parameters for additional filtering or customization, such as:
        - Units of measurement (e.g., metric, imperial)
        - Language for weather descriptions

#### 2. Choose a Weather Service API

1. **Research Available APIs**:
    - Compare popular weather APIs such as:
        - **OpenWeatherMap**: Offers extensive weather data, free tier available with limits.
        - **Weatherstack**: Real-time weather information, straightforward API.
        - **WeatherAPI**: Comprehensive weather data, including historical and forecast data.
2. **Evaluate API Features**:
    - Assess the following aspects:
        - Data availability and accuracy
        - Supported data types (current, forecast, historical)
        - Rate limits and pricing tiers
        - API documentation quality
        - Community and support
3. **Sign Up and Obtain API Key**:
    - Register for the chosen API service and obtain an API key.
    - Review the API usage policies and terms of service.

#### 3. Plan the Architecture
1. **Define Application Layers**:
    - **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and returns responses.
    - **Service Layer**: Contains business logic, processes data, and communicates with external APIs.
    - **Model Layer**: Defines data structures and objects.
    - **Repository Layer**: (Optional) If you plan to store data locally, manage data persistence.
2. **Create High-Level Design**:
    - Sketch the high-level design of the application, focusing on:
        - Interaction between layers
        - Data flow from the controller to the service layer and back
        - Error handling and logging mechanisms
3. **Define Responsibilities**:
    - Clearly delineate responsibilities of each component:
        - Controllers: Request handling, basic validation
        - Services: Business logic, external API communication, data processing
        - Models: Data representation and transformation
        - Repositories: Data storage and retrieval (if applicable)
4. **Select Tools and Frameworks**:
    
    - Identify additional tools and frameworks you might need:
        - Spring Boot for application development
        - RestTemplate or WebClient for HTTP requests
        - JSON processing library (e.g., Jackson) for parsing API responses
        - Spring Security (if you need authentication and authorization)
        - Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation

### Examples

#### Identify Required Information

- Example requirement: "We need the current temperature, humidity, weather condition, and wind speed for a specific city."
- Endpoint: `GET /weather/{city}`

#### Choose a Weather Service API

- Research example: "OpenWeatherMap offers detailed weather data, a generous free tier, and extensive documentation."
- Sign up and obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap.

#### Plan the Architecture

- Define layers:
    - **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests (e.g., `WeatherController`).
    - **Service**: Fetches and processes data from the weather API (e.g., `WeatherService`).
    - **Model**: Defines the data structure for weather data (e.g., `WeatherResponse`).
- High-level design sketch:
    - `WeatherController` -> `WeatherService` -> External Weather API -> Process Response -> Return Processed Data
- Tools:
    - Use Spring Boot for the application.
    - Use RestTemplate or WebClient for making API calls.
